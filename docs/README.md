# Documentation Placeholder

This repository is currently a minimal project shell for the `mqt-core-plugins-catalyst` plugin.

Add project documentation here (Sphinx sources, how-tos, API docs, etc.).

This placeholder exists to satisfy packaging and repository review checks that expect a `docs/` folder.

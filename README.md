# MLIR-Based MQT Core / Catalyst Plugin

This package provides a [Catalyst](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst) plugin based on [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/).
It allows you to use [MQT Core](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core)'s MLIR dialects and transformations within Xanadu's [Catalyst](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst) framework.

If you have any questions, feel free to create a [discussion](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core-plugins-catalyst/discussions) or an [issue](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core-plugins-catalyst/issues) on [GitHub](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core-plugins-catalyst).

## Contributors and Supporters

The _[Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT)](https://mqt.readthedocs.io)_ is developed by the [Chair for Design Automation](https://www.cda.cit.tum.de/) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/) and supported by the [Munich Quantum Software Company (MQSC)](https://munichquantum.software).
Among others, it is part of the [Munich Quantum Software Stack (MQSS)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de/research/research-areas/mqss) ecosystem, which is being developed as part of the [Munich Quantum Valley (MQV)](https://www.munich-quantum-valley.de) initiative.

## Getting Started

`mqt.core.plugins.catalyst` is **NOT YET** available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.core/).

Because `pennylane-catalyst` pins to a specific LLVM/MLIR revision, you must build that LLVM/MLIR locally and point CMake at it.

### 1) Build the exact LLVM/MLIR revision (locally)

```bash
# Pick a workspace (optional)
mkdir -p ~/dev && cd ~/dev

# Clone the exact LLVM revision Catalyst expects
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
cd llvm-project
git checkout f8cb7987c64dcffb72414a40560055cb717dbf74

# Configure & build MLIR (Release is recommended)
cmake -S llvm -B build_llvm -G Ninja \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=mlir \
  -DLLVM_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF \
  -DLLVM_BUILD_TESTS=OFF \
  -DLLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=OFF \
  -DLLVM_INCLUDE_EXAMPLES=OFF \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_ZLIB=FORCE_ON \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_ZSTD=OFF \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET=default

cmake --build build_llvm --config Release

# Export these for your shell/session
export MLIR_DIR="$PWD/build_llvm/lib/cmake/mlir"
export LLVM_DIR="$PWD/build_llvm/lib/cmake/llvm"
```

### 2) Create a local env and build the plugin

TODO: Update once published on PyPI

```console
# From your repo root
cd /path/to/your/mqt-core-plugins-catalyst/plugins/catalyst

# Create and activate a venv (optional)
uv venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate

# Install Catalyst and build the plugin
uv pip install pennylane-catalyst>0.12.0

uv sync --verbose --active
  --config-settings=cmake.define.CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  --config-settings=cmake.define.Python3_EXECUTABLE="$(which python)"
  --config-settings=cmake.define.MLIR_DIR="$MLIR_DIR"
  --config-settings=cmake.define.LLVM_DIR="$LLVM_DIR"
```

### 3) Use the MQT plugin with your PennyLane code

The MQT plugin provides device configuration utilities to prevent Catalyst from decomposing gates into unitary matrices, enabling lossless roundtrip conversions.

**Important:** Use `get_device()` from the MQT plugin instead of `qml.device()` directly:

```python3
import catalyst
import pennylane as qml
from catalyst.passes import apply_pass
from mqt.core.plugins.catalyst import get_device

# Use get_device() to configure the device for MQT plugin compatibility
# This prevents gates from being decomposed into unitary matrices
device = get_device("lightning.qubit", wires=2)


@apply_pass("mqt.mqtopt-to-catalystquantum")
@apply_pass("mqt.catalystquantum-to-mqtopt")
@qml.qnode(device)
def circuit() -> None:
    qml.Hadamard(wires=[0])
    qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])
    # Controlled gates will NOT be decomposed to matrices
    qml.ctrl(qml.PauliX(wires=0), control=1)
    catalyst.measure(0)
    catalyst.measure(1)


@qml.qjit(target="mlir", autograph=True)
def module() -> None:
    return circuit()


# Get the optimized MLIR representation
mlir_output = module.mlir_opt
```

**Alternative:** You can also configure an existing device:

```python3
from mqt.core.plugins.catalyst import configure_device_for_mqt

device = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2)
device = configure_device_for_mqt(device)
```

## System Requirements

Building the MQT Core Catalyst Plugin requires a C++ compiler with support for C++20 and CMake 3.24 or newer.
Building (and running) is continuously tested under Linux and macOS using the [latest available system versions for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).
The MQT Core Catalyst Plugin is compatible with Python version 3.11 and newer.

The MQT Core Catalyst Plugin relies on some external dependencies:

- [llvm/llvm-project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project): A toolkit for the construction of highly optimized compilers, optimizers, and run-time environments (specific revision: `f8cb7987c64dcffb72414a40560055cb717dbf74`).
- [PennyLaneAI/catalyst](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst): A package that enables just-in-time (JIT) compilation of hybrid quantum-classical programs implemented with PennyLane (version > 0.12.0).
- [MQT Core](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core-plugins-catalyst): Provides the MQTOpt MLIR dialect and supporting infrastructure.

Note, both LLVM/MLIR and Catalyst are currently restricted to specific versions. You must build LLVM/MLIR locally from the exact revision specified above and configure CMake to use it (see installation instructions).

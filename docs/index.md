# MQT Core Catalyst Plugin

The **MQT Core Catalyst Plugin** connects the [Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) Core](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core) with [Xanadu's Catalyst](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst) framework.
It provides MLIR conversion passes to translate between Catalyst's Quantum Dialect and MQT's intermediate representation.
